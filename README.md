# python-workout-tracker

This project tracks the workout the user does everyday by taking user input where user mentions what workout he has done for the day and then gets the calorie count burnt by him.

To get the calorie count and ther information I have used Nutrinix API which gets the user input and calculates the calories using Natural langauge query and then returns the results.

Further in this project the results are stored in a spreadsheet -'my workout tracker' using Sheety API.

e.g. of user input - Tell me which exercises you did:2km walking and 5kms running
